# virat-and-toss
Virat losing toss has been a running joke for a long time and we need find a solution for it.
The solution I have thought of is quantum teleportation.
Obviously it is not a feasible solution and looks stupid but it might become a feasible one some day and we might see ICC banning use of it.
If I am being serious, this is just something fun I made to better understand teleportation algorithm.
If you feel the way I have implemented is wrong, please tell me.
